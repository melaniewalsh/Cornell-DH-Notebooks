#  Welcome!


The **Cornell DH Notebook Series** publishes data-driven research by faculty, staff, and students in the form of Jupyter notebooks — documents that can combine runnable code, data, text, images, links, and more. By publishing in this format, we hope to increase the accessibility and reproducibility of our research.

This website is powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and displays Jupyter notebooks as publication-quality web pages.
